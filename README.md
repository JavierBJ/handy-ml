A personal collection of ML pieces of code in case they help somebody.

- [Optimize/Satisfy Early Stopping Criteria](scripts/optimize_satisfy_early_stopping.py): a multi-objective early stopping criterion for training algorithms based on the optimize/satisfy principle.
- [Prediction Confidence](scripts/prediction_confidence.py): very simple linear transformation from predicted probabilities to degrees of confidence in the prediction.
